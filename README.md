# LEADS_SCORE_PROJECT

Problem Statement: 

An education company named X Education sells online courses to our industry professionals.
many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website for courses.

The company is using social Media marketing on various websites and search engines like google
once the people land on websites, they might get intrested and browse courses or fill up a 
form for the course or watch videos.
1. Important to know that these people are classified as leads as they fill up a form 
providing their email address or phone number. 
Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals
2. Important to know that once the they get a lead. sales team contacts them.
3. Important to know that Thru this process, some of the leads get converted while most do 
not. TYPICAL LEAD CONVERSION RATE IS ABOUT 30%.

X Education has now hired you!
They have given you a task.
1. SELECT THE MOST PROMISING LEADS. i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying 
customers.
2. The company requires a model. wherein you need to assign a leadscore to each of the leads
such that the customers with higher lead socre have a higher conversion chance and the
customers with lower lead score havd a lower conversion chance.
3. The CEO, in particular has given a target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Case Study:
1. Build a LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the 
leads which can be used by the company to target potential sales.
2. higher the score would mean that the lead is hot.
hot here means the lead is most likely to convert, whereas a lower score would mean that
the lead is cold and will most likely skip.
